# Introduction to eye-tracking methods

## About this repository
In this repository we develop materials for a course introducing students to some of the eye-tracking methods used in cognitive psychology, psycholinguistics, and related fields.  Materials are published under the CC BY-NC license.  Feel free to use and adapt this material for your own courses.  Also feel free to use our [issue tracker](https://github.com/tmalsburg/eye-tracking-methods/issues) if you spot mistakes.  Contributions are welcome and can be submitted via pull requests.

## Course description

The goal of this course is to put participants in the position to conduct eye-tracking experiments on their own while actually understanding what they are doing.  This means that we will not be satisfied with clicking the buttons in manufacturer-provided software, but we will aim to understand each step in the acquisition, preprocessing, analysis pipeline up to the statistical analysis.  Time permitting we will also look into some prominent computational models of eye movement behavior.

Specific topics: Eye physiology, visual perception, oculo-motor control and types of eye movements, design of eye-tracking experiments, acquisition of eye movement data, eye-tracking quality control, algorithms for the detection of eye movements and gaze fixations,  conventional eye-tracking measures, scanpath analysis, computational models of eye movement behavior.

The course consists of lectures, discussion, supervised practical exercises, and self-organized project work.  We will meet once a week for a lecture and discussion.  Supervised exercises will take place at a fixed time each week in the eye-tracking lab in Keplerstraße 17 (K2, R10.012).  Project work will be conducted in small groups which will also have access to the lab.  As eye-trackers we will use two GazePoint GP3HD and one GP3 remote eye-tracker.  A research-grade SMI IView X tower-mount eye-tracker may also be available for those interested.

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic background in programming in a language such as Python, R, Julia, Matlab, or similar (or willingness to acquire it on your own initiative).
- High school math (or willingness to refresh it on your own initiative).
- Problem solving skills and ability to work independently.

**Expected workload and ECTS:**
