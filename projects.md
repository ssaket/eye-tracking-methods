## Replicating Yarbus
The influence of task instruction on scan paths
  - Super easy to implement
  - Same image for 7 tasks
  - Main message easy to analyze (simple plotting)
  -> further ROI based analyses are possible (e.g. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/i0382)
  -!> Decoding of task (called inverse yarbus) seems to be quite hard
  
## Visual search
Influence of saliency on visual search, target known or not
e.g. grid of T/L with various luminances
  - medium/hard to implement
  - medium analysis (roi-based, continuous covariates)
  ! unsure about effect sizes

## Scene Grammer Lab Dataset
Use [SCEGRAM database](https://www.scenegrammarlab.com/research/development-of-scene-grammar/scegram-database/) and identify fixation durations on target objects
  - easy to implement
  - easy to analysis (roi-based)

## Visual world paradigm
See whether listeners anticipate semantic roles in visual scenes.
  - Not super easy because it involves playing sound and synchronizing sound / eye movements.  But there is an open sesame tutorial for the visual world paradigm that people can refer to for guidance.
  - Analysis limited to creating informative plots and simple t-tests.

## Sentence reading / garden pathing
Demonstrate the garden path effect using eye-tracking: Regressions upon disambiguation and elevated by-word reading times.
  - Experiment difficulty is medium (I think).
  - Analysis is a bit more involved but we can provide guidance and code (if necessary).

## Readability of fonts
Use eye-tracking to investigate the readability of various fonts, e.g., Times New Roman vs. Arial vs. Gothic vs. whatnot.

## Replicate Experiment 2 in Rohde, Levy, Keller (Cognition, 2011).
Goal is to test whether discourse expectations modulate syntactic attachment decisions.  A pretty standard reading design.  Stimuli are available.

## Replicate Visual Search Study Kugler et al 2016
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0145910
Pretty standard visual search task with positive and negative cues (color=red, or color!=red)

# Honorable mention
## Cognitive Load on Pupil
  pupil dilation during n-back tasks
  - medium implementation
  - medium analysis I'd say
