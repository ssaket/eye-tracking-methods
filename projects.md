## Replicating Yarbus
The influence of task instruction on scan paths
  - Super easy to implement
  - Same image for 7 tasks
  - Main message easy to analyze (simple plotting)
  -> further ROI based analyses are possible (e.g. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/i0382)
  -!> Decoding of task (called inverse yarbus) seems to be quite hard
  
## Visual search
Influence of saliency on visual search, target known or not
e.g. grid of T/L with various luminances
  - medium/hard to implement
  - medium analysis (roi-based, continuous covariates)
  ! unsure about effect sizes

## Scene Grammer Lab Dataset
Use [SCEGRAM database](https://www.scenegrammarlab.com/research/development-of-scene-grammar/scegram-database/) and identify fixation durations on target objects
  - easy to implement
  - easy to analysis (roi-based)

# Honorable mention
## Cognitive Load on Pupil
  pupil dilation during n-back tasks
  - medium implementation
  - medium analysis I'd say
